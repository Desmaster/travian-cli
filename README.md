# Travian-CLI

Travian-CLI is a CLI for the online game Travian. Current aims are:

* Being able to read data from the game to either CSV or human-readable form
* Being able to give all commands one would be able to give in-game

Travian-CLI is currently incomplete and under development.

Travian-CLI uses Composer. Having installed composer, one should run `composer install` in the root directory of this project in order for the program to function properly.
